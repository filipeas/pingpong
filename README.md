# Game Ping-Pong

# Developed by computing students at the federal university of piau√≠ (UFPI).

## Game Description
* This game consists of controlling a sliding cube and making it hit only the bottom of the static floating cubes. If the cube passes the rectangular base, the game is over. The sliding cube will increase in speed as time goes on, so be quick to finish the game!

## Development description
* This game was implemented entirely in the c ++ language using graphic libraries, with emphasis on OpenGL
* To run the project, download the repository and run the project using an IDE. Make sure you have a gcc compiler and the GLUT library installed on your machine.
